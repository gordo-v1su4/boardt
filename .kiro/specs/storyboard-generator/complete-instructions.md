# Storyboard Generator - Complete Implementation Instructions

## Project Overview

AI-powered storyboard generator for video content creators built with SvelteKit 5 and Runes. Features chunk-based storytelling with branching narratives, flexible canvas workspace, and professional client presentation views.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: SvelteKit 5 with Runes
- **Canvas Library**: SvelteFlow for drag-and-drop canvas functionality
- **AI Image Generation**: fal.ai API integration
- **State Management**: SvelteKit 5 Runes ($state, $derived, $effect)
- **Styling**: CSS with potential Tailwind CSS integration

## Complete Requirements

### Requirement 1: AI Image Generation
**User Story:** As a video content creator, I want to create storyboards using AI-generated images, so that I can visualize my video concepts before production.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user enters a text prompt THEN the system SHALL generate an image using fal.ai API
2. WHEN image generation is successful THEN the system SHALL display the generated image in the interface
3. IF image generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN the user generates multiple images THEN the system SHALL maintain a collection of all generated images

### Requirement 2: Chunk-Based Canvas Workspace
**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to create story chunks and sequences in a canvas workspace, so that I can build branching narratives and complex story structures visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user creates a story chunk THEN the system SHALL generate a sequence of connected images
2. WHEN the user wants to add keyframes THEN the system SHALL allow insertion between existing frames
3. WHEN the user creates branching paths THEN the system SHALL support multiple story directions (choose-your-own-adventure style)
4. WHEN chunks are connected THEN the system SHALL show visual connections between story sequences
5. WHEN the user adds new story moments THEN the system SHALL create new branches in the narrative tree
6. WHEN working with chunks THEN the system SHALL allow grouping, labeling, and organizing story blocks

### Requirement 3: Professional Set View
**User Story:** As a video producer, I want to view my storyboard in a formal set format, so that I can present a professional sequence to clients and team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user switches to set view THEN the system SHALL display chunks in a structured presentation layout
2. WHEN chunks are in set view THEN the system SHALL show them with story flow visualization
3. WHEN the user reorders chunks in set view THEN the system SHALL update the sequence accordingly
4. WHEN chunks are displayed in set view THEN the system SHALL include titles, descriptions, and story connections
5. WHEN the user switches between views THEN the system SHALL maintain the same chunk collection

### Requirement 4: Seamless View Switching
**User Story:** As a user, I want to seamlessly switch between canvas and set views, so that I can work flexibly and present professionally without losing my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user clicks the canvas tab THEN the system SHALL switch to canvas view mode
2. WHEN the user clicks the set tab THEN the system SHALL switch to formal set view mode
3. WHEN switching views THEN the system SHALL preserve all chunk data and arrangements
4. WHEN in either view THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent navigation and controls
5. WHEN switching views THEN the system SHALL provide smooth visual transitions

### Requirement 5: Project Management
**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to manage my storyboard project data, so that I can save, load, and continue working on my storyboards across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user creates a new storyboard THEN the system SHALL initialize an empty project
2. WHEN the user makes changes THEN the system SHALL automatically save the current state
3. WHEN the user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL restore the previous session state
4. WHEN the user wants to start fresh THEN the system SHALL provide a clear/reset option
5. WHEN the user exports the storyboard THEN the system SHALL provide downloadable formats (PDF, etc.)

### Requirement 6: Performance & Responsiveness
**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be responsive and performant, so that I can work efficiently on different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL be responsive on desktop and tablet devices
2. WHEN handling multiple chunks THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth performance
3. WHEN generating images THEN the system SHALL provide loading indicators and progress feedback
4. WHEN the user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms for UI actions
5. WHEN images are large THEN the system SHALL optimize display without losing quality

## Key Data Models

### Story Chunk Model
```javascript
class StoryChunk {
  constructor(data) {
    this.id = data.id || crypto.randomUUID();
    this.title = data.title || 'Untitled Chunk';
    this.description = data.description || '';
    this.images = data.images || []; // Array of StoryboardImage
    this.connections = data.connections || []; // Connected chunk IDs
    this.chunkType = data.chunkType || 'sequence'; // 'sequence', 'choice', 'keyframe'
    this.position = data.position || { x: 0, y: 0 };
    this.metadata = data.metadata || {};
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Storyboard Store
```javascript
class StoryboardStore {
  chunks = $state([]);
  connections = $state([]);
  canvasLayout = $state({ nodes: [], edges: [] });
  currentView = $state('canvas');
  
  // Derived states
  storyFlow = $derived(() => 
    this.buildStoryTree(this.chunks, this.connections)
  );
}
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Complete foundation setup and data models
2. **Move to Phase 2**: Build core services (fal.ai, storage, basic UI)
3. **Phase 3 - Agent Work**: Each agent works on their assigned components in parallel
4. **Phase 4**: Integration, testing, and final polish

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Component logic, stores, services
- **Integration Tests**: Canvas interactions, view switching
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows with Playwright
- **Performance Tests**: Image loading, canvas rendering

## Success Criteria

- Users can create story chunks with multiple connected images
- Canvas supports branching narratives and keyframe insertion
- Professional presentation view exports to PDF
- Seamless switching between canvas and presentation modes
- Responsive performance on desktop and tablet devices
