# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a single-page web application for generating storyboards and key frames for video content creation. The application will be built using SvelteKit 5 with Runes and integrate with fal.ai for AI-powered image generation. The app will provide two distinct interfaces: a flexible canvas workspace for drag-and-drop storyboard creation and a formal set view for structured storyboard presentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a video content creator, I want to create storyboards using AI-generated images, so that I can visualize my video concepts before production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters a text prompt THEN the system SHALL generate an image using fal.ai API
2. WHEN image generation is successful THEN the system SHALL display the generated image in the interface
3. IF image generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN the user generates multiple images THEN the system SHALL maintain a collection of all generated images

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to arrange storyboard frames in a flexible canvas workspace, so that I can experiment with different visual sequences and layouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the canvas view THEN the system SHALL provide a drag-and-drop interface
2. WHEN the user drags an image THEN the system SHALL allow positioning anywhere on the canvas
3. WHEN the user drops an image THEN the system SHALL place the image at the drop location
4. WHEN the user selects an image on canvas THEN the system SHALL provide resize and rotation controls
5. WHEN the user moves images THEN the system SHALL maintain the relative positioning of all elements
6. WHEN the user saves the canvas layout THEN the system SHALL persist the arrangement

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a video producer, I want to view my storyboard in a formal set format, so that I can present a professional sequence to clients and team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user switches to set view THEN the system SHALL display images in a structured grid layout
2. WHEN images are in set view THEN the system SHALL show them in chronological or user-defined order
3. WHEN the user reorders frames in set view THEN the system SHALL update the sequence accordingly
4. WHEN frames are displayed in set view THEN the system SHALL include frame numbers and optional captions
5. WHEN the user switches between views THEN the system SHALL maintain the same image collection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to seamlessly switch between canvas and set views, so that I can work flexibly and present professionally without losing my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the canvas tab THEN the system SHALL switch to canvas view mode
2. WHEN the user clicks the set tab THEN the system SHALL switch to formal set view mode
3. WHEN switching views THEN the system SHALL preserve all image data and arrangements
4. WHEN in either view THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent navigation and controls
5. WHEN switching views THEN the system SHALL provide smooth visual transitions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to manage my storyboard project data, so that I can save, load, and continue working on my storyboards across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates a new storyboard THEN the system SHALL initialize an empty project
2. WHEN the user makes changes THEN the system SHALL automatically save the current state
3. WHEN the user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL restore the previous session state
4. WHEN the user wants to start fresh THEN the system SHALL provide a clear/reset option
5. WHEN the user exports the storyboard THEN the system SHALL provide downloadable formats

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be responsive and performant, so that I can work efficiently on different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL be responsive on desktop and tablet devices
2. WHEN handling multiple images THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth performance
3. WHEN generating images THEN the system SHALL provide loading indicators and progress feedback
4. WHEN the user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms for UI actions
5. WHEN images are large THEN the system SHALL optimize display without losing quality
